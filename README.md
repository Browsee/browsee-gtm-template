# browsee-gtm-template

This project is a community template for integrating [Browsee](https://browsee.io/) with Google Tag Manager [Community Template Gallery template repository](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9454109).

## Description

Browsee helps you prioritize your product based on how users are using it. It automatically understands what your users like and where they are experiencing issues. Say goodbye to guesswork in funnel analysis and try out this new and intuitive way to understand your users.

* **How are users using my site ?** - Using session recordings you can see a users's view of the product, their mouse movements as well as clicks. Just like a video recording.
* **Where are users dropping in my conversion funnel ?** - With Browsee funnels you can watch just the sessions where users drop after each step. Stop guessing why your users left, watch their reactions to your product.
* **How is this page performing ?** - Create heatmaps and aggregate thousands of journeys to see where users are clicking, spending time and scrolling to.
* **What are the broad category of users on this page ?** - Watch a page's crowd simulation to watch hundreds of journeys on a page simultaneously. Instantly see broad segments of users and understand their behavior.
* **Where are users experiencing issues ?** - Browsee automatically identifies where users are frustrated using their click pattern and page browsing and tags these sessions. Watch them to understand common experience issues.
* **Are my users experiencing slowness or errors ?** - Browsee's development package provides detailed analysis and session replay of each Javascript Error, Server Error, Slow Ajax and Broken links. Don't wait for your users to file support tickets. Detect them automatically using Browsee and improve customer satisfaction.

This plugin provides a simple installation of Browsee on your site, giving you immediate access to all Browsee features.
